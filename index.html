        So this was a question that I posed to myself a while back.<br> 
        It's something that has been eating me up for some time now, and to be honest-<br> 
        all it does is open up some room for a heated argument if left under a complete<br>
        lack of supervision. Rather than spewing vulgar insults and baseless falsities<br> 
        all throughout, I'd much prefer that we all lead the way for an open conversation!<br> 
        So please don't bother trying to comment something sinister down below the comment<br>
        section. .<br>
<br>
        For starters, it would've been most torturous for us men if we were in a<br>
        woman's shoes back in the day ( in the early to mid-19th century to be exact ).<br> 
        While that may seem blunt from the surface, evidence alone does indeed imply that<br> 
        they were consistently alienated, shackled, and ridiculed all throughout their life,<br> 
        and guess what! from that point onward, it's not even something as alleged as an implication,<br> 
        it was their reality and their truth! I mean, have you people seen the sheer amount of documentaries<br>
        filmed over this stuff? Anyhow, I'm going off-topic here. My point was that men would probably despise<br>
        the lack of control they'd then have if they laced shut in a " female's place " or so society indicates.<br>

<br>

        Men were well known for their fragile egos and misplaced judgments of the average woman.<br> 
        These judgments did indeed stem from their fear of losing control and authority over a woman;<br> 
        moreover, some might argue that women would have wreaked havoc across left and right if they<br>
        were permitted to " run along scot-free " though truthfully speaking, they were nothing<br> 
        if not terrified of such " major " loss of ego fuel.
<br>

        Men back in the day would incessantly claim and reaffirm the belief that women were more<br>
        suited for house chores and raising children, though, in reality, their arguments were pointless<br>
        at best ( let us not delve further into that rabbit hole )<br>
<br>

        To finish things off: women still are and will always be the backbone of society,<br> 
        whether they're versed in any industry or job. Chaining them down to the wheel misfortune<br>
        would do us no good! Cooperation is necessary, and we should always remind ourselves of that.<br>
<br>
        Feel free to disagree with anything stated! Though we must all keep things civil!!<br>
